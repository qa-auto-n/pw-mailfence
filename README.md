## **About**

This repository includes a test suite that covers important functionalities of a web application. Using Playwright, we automate the process of logging in, interacting with core sections like Messages and Documents, and verifying their expected behavior.

---

## **Features**

- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate critical user flows like navigation, login, message management, document handling, and more.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests are executed across multiple browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `.env` files to manage sensitive data like credentials and other settings.
- **GitHub Actions**: Integrated with CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically on every push or pull request.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Playwright**: Powerful framework for automating browsers in Node.js.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for running tests.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating the testing and deployment process.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe programming for a more robust test suite.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## **Setup & Installation**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

Add correct credentials to the .env file in the root of the project

4. **Install Playwright Browsers**:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```
## **Running Tests**
You can run the tests locally using the following command:
```bash
npx playwright test
   ```
To run a specific test file or test suite, you can pass the test file name like this:
```bash
npx playwright test path/to/test-file.spec.ts
   ```
You can run tests in parallel by using Playwright's built-in parallel execution:
```bash
npx playwright test --workers=4
```

## **GitHub Actions**
This project is integrated with GitHub Actions to automate the process of running tests on every push or pull request.
### Workflow
**Runs on**: push and pull_request events for main and master branches.
**Actions**: The GitHub Actions workflow installs dependencies, sets up Playwright browsers, and runs the tests. The test results are uploaded as artifacts.
