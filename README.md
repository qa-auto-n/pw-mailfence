# **Playwright Test Automation Project** ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Playwright Test Automation Project**! This repository demonstrates **end-to-end (E2E) test automation** for a web application using **Playwright**, a modern and powerful browser automation framework. The tests validate core workflows such as user authentication, message management, document handling, and more to ensure the application's functionality is robust and reliable.

## **About**

This project is designed to automate and validate the core functionalities of a web application. Using **Playwright**, we simulate real user interactionsâ€”such as logging in, navigating the app, managing messages, handling documents, and verifying expected behaviors. Our goal is to ensure the application works seamlessly across different browsers and environments.

---

## **Features**

- **End-to-End Testing**: Automates critical user flows such as login, navigation, message management, and document handling.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensures compatibility across **Chromium**, **Firefox**, and **WebKit**.
- **Environment Variables**: Securely manage sensitive data, like credentials, using `.env` files.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate testing with CI/CD pipelines that run on every push or pull request.
- **Parallel Execution**: Save time by running tests in parallel to improve efficiency.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)**: Fast and reliable browser automation framework.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: JavaScript runtime for executing tests.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Adds type safety and improves code quality.
- **[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)**: Automates testing and deployment workflows.

## **Setup & Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qa-auto-n/pw-mailfence.git
    cd pw-mailfence
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Add the necessary credentials to the `.env` file in the root of the project:
    ```bash
    AUTH_STATE_PATH=.auth
    BASE_URL=https://mailfence.com
    USERNAME=your-mailfence-username
    PASSWORD=your-mailfence-password
    ```
   Replace `your-mailfence-username` and `your-mailfence-password` with your actual credentials.

4. **Install Playwright Browsers**:
   Install the required browsers for Playwright:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install --with-deps
    ```

---

## **Running Tests**

You can run the tests locally using the following command:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

To run a specific test file or suite, pass the file name like this:
```bash
npx playwright test path/to/test-file.spec.ts
```

For parallel execution, use Playwrightâ€™s built-in functionality:
```bash
npx playwright test --workers=4
```

---

## **GitHub Actions**

This project is integrated with **GitHub Actions** to automate testing on every push or pull request to the `main` or `master` branches.

### **Workflow**
**Runs on**: push and pull_request events for `main` and `master` branches.

**Actions**: The workflow installs dependencies, sets up Playwright browsers, and runs the tests. Test results are uploaded as artifacts.

---

## **Linting and Code Quality**

To maintain consistent coding standards and high-quality code, this project uses **ESLint**.

### **How to Use ESLint**

After setting up the project, you can run ESLint to check for issues and ensure your code adheres to the project's style guide.

Run ESLint with the following command:
```bash
npx eslint .
```

To run ESLint on a specific file or folder:
```bash
npx eslint path/to/your-file.ts
```

### **Automatic Fixing**
ESLint can automatically fix certain issues. To fix issues automatically, use:
```bash
npx eslint . --fix
```

This will fix linting issues where possible according to the projectâ€™s ESLint configuration.
